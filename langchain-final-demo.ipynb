The team is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), one of the four power conferences in college football. The program began in 1926 and joined the ACC in 2004, competing in the conference's Coastal Division from 2005 until the ACC eliminated divisions in 2023.\n",
            "The Miami Hurricanes are among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Miami has won five AP national championships in 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991, and 2001. Miami is ranked fifth on the list of all-time Associated Press National Poll Championships, tied with USC and behind Alabama, Notre Dame,  Ohio State, and Oklahoma. Two Hurricanes, Vinny Testaverde in 1986 and Gino Toretta in 1992, have won the Heisman Trophy. As of 2023, eight University of Miami players and four coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Among players, Bennie Blades, Don Bosseler, Ted Hendricks, Russell Maryland, Ed Reed, Vinny Testaverde, Gino Torretta, and Arnold Tucker have been inducted. Coaches inducted include Dennis Erickson, Andy Gustafson, Jack Harding, and Jimmy Johnson.\n",
            "As of the end of the 2023 season, the Miami Hurricanes have a compiled record of 663–388–19 since the program's 1926 founding. In addition to its five national championships, the University of Miami has won nine conference championships and appeared in 42 major bowl games.\n",
            "As of 2024, eleven Miami Hurricanes have been inducted into the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame: Jim Otto in 1980, Ted Hendricks in 1990, Jim Kelly in 2002, Michael Irvin in 2007, Cortez Kennedy in 2012, Warren Sapp in 2013, Ray Lewis in 2018, Ed Reed in 2019, Edgerrin James in 2020, and Devin Hester and Andre Johnson in 2024.\n",
            "Since 2008, the University of Miami has played its home games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, roughly 22 miles (35 km) north of the university's primary campus in Coral Gables. Prior to 2008, from 1937 until 2007, Miami played their home games at the Miami Orange Bowl in the Little Havana section of Miami, which was demolished in 2008 after 71 years of use by the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the Hurricanes, and for other athletic and entertainment purposes.\n",
            "In December 2021, the University of Miami announced the appointment of Mario Cristobal as the team's new coach. Cristobal signed a 10-year, $80 million contract with the Hurricanes.\n",
